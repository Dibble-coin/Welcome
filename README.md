# **DibbleCoin** will revolutionize environmental preservation.

> Originally created in 2009, **Plant your Seed&copy;** was designed as a project to protect the environment, but lacked the financial capacity to make it work globally. With the advent of Bitcoin and other digital currencies however, boundaries have been eliminated and allowing for worldwide implementation of **Plant your Seed&copy;** has become easier. Thus, **DIBBLECOIN** came into being - merging a key objective: environmental conservation - with cryptocurrencie's technological capabilities.


## DibbleCoin is a *stablecoin*
Dibblecoin is a cryptocurrency that is linked to a square meter plot of untouched forest in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, guaranteeing its stability.

### The Unwavering Backing of Dibblecoin: Nature's Guardianship.

**Plant your Seed&copy; , The DibbleCoin Company** ,intends to acquire an area of ***148,528.7854 hectares*** in the **Brazilian Amazon**, which is equivalent to one billion four hundred million square meters ***(1,400,000,000.00 m2)***. 

### The circulating supply of Dibblecoin
And in doing so, **DibbleCoin** will be issued with ***1.400,000,000*** coins - each representing one square meter. One can invest in Masternote through the **DibbleCoin** wallet and receive a **digital Carbon Credit certificate** that allows them to rent out to businesses that require it year on year. Much of this process will be made simpler by making use of smart contracts and certificates authenticated by authorities.

### How will the project work? What will be done? 
Once the land is acquired, it will be declared an eternal reserve and remain unchanged. Special research facilities will be constructed to promote natural medicines and climate/vegetation conservation. An advanced center to support local wildlife also will be put in place. To follow the terrain, a resort that emphasizes learning and environmental consciousness instead of typical vacationing activities will be set up.
